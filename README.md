### Clean Code Principles
- Meaningful names
- Small, focused functions/methods
- Proper error handling

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
```python
# Test strategy pattern
def test_basic_pricing():
    strategy = BasicPricingStrategy()
    ticket = create_test_ticket(duration_hours=2, vehicle_type=VehicleType.CAR)
    fee = strategy.calculate_fee(ticket)
    assert fee == 20.0  # 2 hours × $10/hour

def test_peak_hour_pricing():
    strategy = PeakHourPricingStrategy()
    ticket = create_peak_hour_ticket(duration_hours=1, vehicle_type=VehicleType.CAR)
    fee = strategy.calculate_fee(ticket)
    assert fee == 15.0  # 1 hour × $10 × 1.5 multiplier
```

### Integration Testing
```python
# Test parking workflow
def test_vehicle_parking_workflow():
    manager = ParkingManager(BasicPricingStrategy())
    manager.add_multiple_spaces([...])
    
    vehicle = VehicleFactory.create_vehicle(...)
    ticket = manager.park_vehicle(vehicle)
    
    exit_ticket = manager.retrieve_vehicle(vehicle.registration_number)
    assert exit_ticket.charge_amount > 0
```

### Event Testing
```python
# Test observer notifications
def test_observer_notifications():
    manager = ParkingManager(BasicPricingStrategy())
    observer = MockObserver()
    manager.attach_observer(observer)
    
    ticket = manager.park_vehicle(vehicle)
    assert observer.on_vehicle_entry_called
```
